# Amazon Product Review Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook `Majorproject.ipynb` that performs an analysis of Amazon product reviews. The analysis focuses on extracting insights and information from customer reviews of a particular product.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze customer reviews of a specific product listed on Amazon. The analysis covers various aspects, including sentiment analysis, word cloud visualization, feature extraction, and time-based analysis.

## Contents

- `Majorproject.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the entire codebase of the project. It covers data collection through web scraping using Beautiful Soup, data preprocessing, sentiment analysis using the NLTK library's VADER sentiment analyzer, feature extraction using TF-IDF and Doc2Vec, visualization of word clouds, and time-based analysis of reviews.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Amazon-Review-Analysis.git
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Majorproject.ipynb` to explore the code and understand the project's implementation.

3. Install the required libraries using the following commands:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk gensim wordcloud
   ```

4. Run the code cells in the notebook to execute the analysis on Amazon product reviews. The notebook covers steps like web scraping, sentiment analysis, feature extraction, and visualization.

## Project Highlights

- Web scraping using Beautiful Soup to extract review data from Amazon product page.
- Sentiment analysis using the VADER sentiment analyzer to categorize reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Word cloud visualization of frequently used words in both review titles and contents.
- Feature extraction techniques such as TF-IDF and Doc2Vec to represent review texts.
- Time-based analysis to explore trends and patterns in customer reviews over specific months and years.
